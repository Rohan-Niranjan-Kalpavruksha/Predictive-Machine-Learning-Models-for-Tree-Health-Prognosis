The project aimed to predict the health of trees in New York City using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the NYC 2015 Street Tree Census dataset, the team explored various predictive models to classify tree health based on factors such as tree diameter, location, and environmental conditions. The dataset contained information on over 600,000 trees, including their health status, location, and physical characteristics. Through exploratory data analysis, the team identified key variables and potential challenges, such as class imbalance and missing data. Various machine learning algorithms were employed: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. To improve model accuracy, future efforts could focus on feature engineering, advanced ensemble techniques, and collaboration with domain experts to better understand the underlying factors influencing tree health. Additionally, exploring alternative datasets or incorporating additional environmental variables may provide valuable insights for more accurate predictions.
